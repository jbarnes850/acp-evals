Example: Binary vs Continuous Evaluation Comparison

This example demonstrates the practical differences between binary and continuous
evaluation modes using real LLM API calls. Based on research from "Evaluating
the Effectiveness of LLM-Evaluators" (Yan, 2024).

Requirements:
    - Set OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in your environment
    - Run: python examples/14_binary_evaluation_example.py
